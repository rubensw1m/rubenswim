                <h2>2025_03_26 // trying to find myself again</h2>
                <p>oh, i don't understand what's happening to me lately. i'm so tired of it all, i'm just starting to lose my self, i'm losing my loved ones with my behavior. this has already happened to me, from last October, till this February. <br>
                it seemed like everything was starting to get better, the weather was nice outside, everything was okay..? oh. i was wrong. everything seems to go like downhill. i started feeling so bad, so lonely. i have to take a rest from everyone for maybe 4 days, or maybe 5? who knows. <br><br>
                i dont want to hurt anyone with my anger, but i just can't stand seeing how the closest friend of mine is just giving the signs, that she doesn't want to speak with me. it hurts but i can't do anything. i tried to speak with her about this but nothing really changed since then... <br><br>
                i'm not trying to sound like a little crybaby, but that's how it is, unfortunately.
               <br><br> hope i will go through this.</p>
